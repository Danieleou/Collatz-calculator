# Calculator Collatz

## Context
In mathematics there is an open problem which is following:

A positive integer is taken, if this even number is divided by 2, if it is odd it is multiplied by 3 and 1 is added.

Now if this procedure is done many times, you arrive at number 1, for example, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2 , 1.

Now if it is done with the number 1 this procedure creates a cycle 1, 4, 2, 1.

So the question is if all the numbers fall to this cycle, that to this day it is not known if it is true or false.

## This project

This desktop app does is calculate the sequence of numbers that generates these rules, how long is this sequence and what was the maximum number that was reached.
